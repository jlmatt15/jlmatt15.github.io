title: "Transfer of articulatory targets in production of second language Korean sibilants"
collection: publications
category: presentations
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This project uses lingual ultrasound, lip video, and acoustic data to examine how L1 English-L2
Korean speakers use L1 sibilant categories to produce the Korean /s/-/s’/ contrast. [...]Most learners did not produce a difference between L2 Korean /s/ and /s’/ in peak frequency, suggesting no place of articulation difference, since peak frequency is expected to correlate to the size of the oral cavity anterior to the constriction. The learners produce the Korean sibilants with a peak frequency intermediate between English /s/ or /ʃ/. Articulatory results show variation across learners.'
